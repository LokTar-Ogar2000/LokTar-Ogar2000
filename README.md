- âš¡ Fun fact:My favorite smell is the after-rain smell, which is called petrichor. Petrichor is actually a bacteria that tries to attract arthropods to spread more of itself. For some reason, humans' scent sensitivity for petrichor is ten parts per trillion. That is a stronger sensitivity than a shark's scent for blood, which is one part per billion.
